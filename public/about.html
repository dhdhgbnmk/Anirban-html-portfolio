<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others. 
  There is nothing without purpose in this world. 
  Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. 
  Thus, writing about myself, I’m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. 
  I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.</p>

<p>I’m from a middle-class family of Kolkata, I am Anirban Das. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends.
   Actually, whatever I will be, it is just because of my family.</p>

<p>I am a working professional used to work as a Software Developer.I love travelling,Painting,playing Cricket and so on.
  I also love to spend quality time with my family,hanging around with friends,colleagues.
